# What's For Dinner?

## React Demonstrating Class Based Components

[DEMO LINK](https://moonlit-tiramisu-189bb2.netlify.app/)

## Description

I've recently learned how to build class based components. To solidify and demonstate that knowledge, I have converted my most recent project [What's For Dinner](https://effulgent-bunny-bbabbb.netlify.app/) || [Source Code](https://github.com/TallSoup/Whats-For-Dinner) that was built entirely with modern, functional, components, to class based.

I left the functional components in the code, commented out to show the difference. The finished project is identical.

This will be valuable knowledge when working with legacy codebases, and for occasions where class-based components are required (such as when using error boundaries, for the time being)

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript ES6+
- JSX
- React (Class-Based Components)
- Bootstrap 5
- Heroku
- Git and Github

I used the [Spoontacular API](https://spoonacular.com/) which provides 150 free API calls per day.

## Features

Input what you have in your fridge/pantry/cold cellar, and it will return a dozen recipes that use those items, and indicate additional ingredients you need. Then click thru for the detailed recipe.
